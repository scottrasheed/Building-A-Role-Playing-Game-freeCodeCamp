🧙‍♂️ JavaScript RPG Practice Project (freeCodeCamp)

Introduction

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It’s one of the core web technologies, alongside HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript, making it essential for web development.

In this freeCodeCamp practice project, you'll apply what you've learned by building the logic for a simple Role Playing Game (RPG) using JavaScript. This exercise helps reinforce key programming fundamentals in a fun and interactive way.

✅ What You’ll Practice

This project will help you strengthen your understanding of:

✅ Variables and data types

✅ Functions and return values

✅ If/else conditionals

✅ Loops

✅ Arrays and how to work with them

✅ Objects and basic structure

✅ String interpolation

✅ Writing clean, reusable logic

📂 Files in This Project

getAverage.js — Calculates the average of scores in an array

getGrade.js — Converts a score into a letter grade

hasPassingGrade.js — Checks if a student passed based on grade

studentMsg.js — Combines the above to return a class performance message

💻 How to Run It

You can test your code in any of the following ways:

Paste the code into the console tab of your browser's Developer Tools

Use an online editor like:

freeCodeCamp's JS playground

replit.com

OneCompiler

🧪 Sample Output

Class average: 81.5. Your grade: B. You passed the course.

🎯 Goal of the Project

By the end of this practice, you should be able to:

Write modular JavaScript functions

Understand how different parts of a program work together

Use conditionals and logic to simulate simple real-world outcomes (like grading or passing a course)

🏁 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable, try enhancing this logic into a more complete RPG by adding:

Health, attack, and defense values

Turn-based combat with if/else and loops

Inventory using arrays or objects

A leveling system based on score or experience
